# 📝 Project Plan: Mini Redis (Key-Value Store)

## 🔹 Step 1: Define Project Scope & Features
We aim to build a simple in-memory key-value store with basic Redis-like behavior. The core functionality will include:

- **TCP Server**: Clients can connect via TCP.
- **Command Handling**: Support for `SET key value` and `GET key`.
- **Concurrency**: Handle multiple client connections.
- **Data Storage**: In-memory `HashMap` for storing key-value pairs.
- **Persistence (optional)**: Save/load data from disk.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Define High-Level Architecture

### 1️⃣ Core Components

### **TCP Server**
- Listens for incoming connections.
- Spawns a handler for each client.

### **Command Parser**
- Reads commands from clients.
- Parses input (e.g., `SET foo bar` → `key=foo, value=bar`).

### **Storage Layer**
- Uses `HashMap<String, String>` as an in-memory store.
- Uses `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<..>>>` to share the store across threads.

### **Concurrency Handling**
- **Threaded version**: Each connection is handled in a separate thread.
- **Async version**: Uses `tokio` for efficient async handling.

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Plan the Data Flow

### **Client-Server Interaction**
1. **Client sends a command over TCP**, e.g., `"SET foo bar"`.
2. **Server receives the command**, parses it.
3. **Server updates or retrieves data** from the `HashMap`.
4. **Server responds back** with `"OK"` or the stored value.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Define Commands

| Command             | Functionality                           |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `SET key value`    | Stores a key-value pair in memory    |
| `GET key`          | Retrieves the value of a key         |
| `DEL key` *(optional)* | Deletes a key                      |
| `EXPIRE key seconds` *(optional)* | Sets a time-to-live for a key |

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Choose Technologies & Libraries

| Component         | Choice                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Language**     | Rust                                       |
| **TCP Handling** | `std::net::TcpListener` (basic) or `tokio::net::TcpListener` (async) |
| **Concurrency**  | `std::thread` (basic) or `tokio` (async)  |
| **Storage**      | `HashMap<String, String>`                 |
| **Synchronization** | `Arc<Mutex<HashMap<..>>>`             |

## 🔹 Step 6: Implementation Plan

---

### ✅ **Phase 1: Basic TCP Server**
- Open a TCP socket and listen for connections.
- Accept multiple clients.

---

### ✅ **Phase 2: Implement Key-Value Storage**
- Use a `HashMap` to store key-value pairs.
- Implement `SET` and `GET` commands.

---

### ✅ **Phase 3: Handle Concurrency**
- **Basic:** Use threads (`std::thread::spawn`).
- **Advanced:** Use async (`tokio::spawn`).

---

### ✅ **Phase 4: Add Error Handling & Robust Parsing**
- Handle invalid commands gracefully.
- Ensure proper error messages.

---

### ✅ **Phase 5: Add Persistence (Optional)**
- Write key-value pairs to a file (Append-Only File - AOF).
- Load data at startup.
- Implement periodic snapshots to optimize startup time.

---

### ✅ **Phase 6: Add EXPIRE and DEL Features**
- Implement `EXPIRE` to set a TTL (Time-To-Live) for keys.
- Implement `DEL` to delete keys from the store.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 7: Implement PUB/SUB**
- Implement efficient **Pub/Sub** using `tokio::sync::broadcast`.
- Allow multiple clients to subscribe to channels and receive messages.
- Implement `PUBLISH`, `SUBSCRIBE`, and `UNSUBSCRIBE` commands.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 8: Optimize Persistence & Add Backups**
- Optimize the persistence mechanism using **log compaction**.
- Introduce periodic **backups to external storage** (like AWS S3).
- Reduce the size of the AOF file for better performance.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 9: Implement Clustering for Distributed Storage**
- Split the data into **shards** and distribute them across multiple nodes.
- Implement **consistent hashing** for balanced data distribution.
- Use `etcd` or `Consul` for **service discovery**.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 10: Distributed Pub/Sub System**
- Enhance Pub/Sub for cross-node messaging.
- Integrate a message broker like **Kafka** or **Redis Streams** for distributed messaging.
- Ensure message consistency and delivery guarantees across nodes.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 11: Advanced Optimizations for Scalability**
- Optimize internal data structures for handling high-concurrency operations.
- Introduce **connection pooling** to reduce connection overhead.
- Use **zero-copy networking** techniques for efficient data handling.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 12: Observability & Monitoring**
- Integrate with **Prometheus** for metrics collection.
- Monitor key metrics like query latency, memory usage, and connection counts.
- Use `tracing` for structured, async logging.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 13: Security Enhancements**
- Add **API authentication** using tokens or API keys.
- Implement **TLS** for encrypted data transmission.
- Introduce **rate limiting** to prevent abuse from malicious clients.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 14: Horizontal Scaling with Kubernetes**
- Containerize the application using **Docker**.
- Deploy using **Kubernetes** with:
  - Auto-scaling based on load.
  - Health checks and self-healing capabilities.
  - Load balancing across nodes.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 15: Testing and Hardening**
- Write comprehensive **unit, integration, and load tests**.
- Perform **chaos testing** to simulate real-world failures and network partitions.
- Validate system reliability under stress.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 16: Performance Optimization for Production**
- Use profiling tools like `perf` or `flamegraph` to identify bottlenecks.
- Optimize critical paths in code for latency and throughput.
- Minimize memory usage and optimize I/O paths.

---

### 🔜 **Phase 17: API and Client Libraries**
- Expose an optional **HTTP API** for key-value operations and monitoring.
- Build **client libraries** for different languages (Rust, Python, JavaScript).

---

### 🔜 **Phase 18: Final Optimization and Documentation**
- Optimize for minimal latency and maximum throughput.
- Write comprehensive documentation and examples.
- Ensure high availability and disaster recovery strategies.

## 🚀 **Final Outcome**
By completing these phases, the project will evolve into:
- A **scalable, distributed, and persistent key-value store**.
- Capable of handling **high loads and real-time pub/sub messaging**.
- Equipped with **robust persistence, security, and observability** for production readiness.
